# My Habit Tracker

> While this is a learning exercise, it'll need to be a useful application for personal daily use.

## Milestone 1
1. Create an app in Vue 3 that lets you track/save your daily habits
2. It shows the basic chart on progress using D3.js
3. To save data, it'll use local storage. //TODO: can we save elsewhere for free so that we can restore lost data?
